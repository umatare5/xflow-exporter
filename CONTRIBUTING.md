## Commands

The following `make` commands are available for development and testing:

| Command                   | Description                                  |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| `make help`               | Display available targets and requirements   |
| `make build`              | Build the binary to `./tmp/xflow-exporter`   |
| `make lint`               | Run golangci-lint and tidy go.mod            |
| `make test-unit`          | Run unit tests with coverage using gotestsum |
| `make test-unit-coverage` | Generate HTML coverage report                |
| `make clean`              | Remove build artifacts and backup files      |
| `make image`              | Build Docker image                           |

## Build

The repository includes a ready to use `Dockerfile`. To build a new Docker image:

```bash
make image
```

This cross-compiles a Linux binary into `./tmp/image`, then builds from that directory because the `Dockerfile` expects the binary at the context root. The image is tagged `$USER/xflow-exporter` and declares ports 10052 and 2055/udp without publishing them, so publish them with `docker run -p`. Released images are pushed to `ghcr.io/umatare5/xflow-exporter` by GoReleaser instead.

## Release

To release a new version, follow these steps:

1. Add the `## [vX.Y.Z]` section to `CHANGELOG.md` above the previous release, matching the version in the `VERSION` file, and add that version's release link at the foot of the file.
2. Update the version in the `VERSION` file.
3. Submit a pull request with both files.

Merging that pull request is the whole release. A push to `main` touching `VERSION` runs the release workflow, which tags the commit and publishes the release in the same run.

The workflow also accepts a manual run from the Actions tab. That is for the release a path filter could not reach, the first one above all: the push that creates a branch carries nothing to compare paths against.

## Pull requests

1. Fork ([https://github.com/umatare5/xflow-exporter/fork](https://github.com/umatare5/xflow-exporter/fork))
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Record any change to the metric surface under a `## [vX.Y.Z]` section for the coming version in `CHANGELOG.md`, adding the section if it is not there yet
5. Rebase your local changes against the `main` branch
6. Create a new Pull Request
